# GeraltofRivia-Minigame

A text based minigame I made as a personal project.

#How to Run the Game
Run the geralt.exe file. If that does not work, then add the java files in a new project in eclipse and run it there.

#Description
The minigame is inspired by the Witcher videogames. In the minigame you play as Geralt of Rivia, and you are tasked with clearing a nearby cave of all monsters. This cave has 9 caverns in total, and the game begins with you in cavern 0. You must traverse the caverns to find your tools and attack the monsters. 
There are 3 monsters in total. The rock troll can be killed with just a sword in your inventory. For defeating the ghouls, you must have the swords and potion in your inventory. To defeat the Katakan, you must have the sword, potion, and vampire blade oil. After defeating all monsters the game ends and you win.
